      <description>A website for the Seconda Giornata DinAmica, or 2nd DAI Day, is up and running:
https://eventi.unibo.it/dinamiciday2
The program of the day should be rather stable but we do not exclude that it might undergo small variations.
To facilitate the organization, we are asking all participants to register at the page: https://eventi.unibo.it/dinamiciday2/registrazione. Also, please download the poster and post it in your institution.
Finally, on the evening of the 21st, a number of us will meet for dinner in a restaurant to be decided.</description>

      <description>In keeping with our just-established tradition, 2018 is the year of the DinAmicI Day, the one-day long social meeting of the DinAmici. Thus, some of us (C. Bonanno, A. M. Cherubini, M. Lenci, A. Sorrentino) are organizing the
Seconda Giornata DinAmica at Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (!) on 21 December 2018
The meeting day will include a small number of lectures/seminars and our Assemby. A detailed program will be announced soon, but for now save the date!</description>

&amp;ldquo;Stable and Chaotic Motions in the Planetary Problem&amp;rdquo;
will take place in Asiago (Italy), June 10-15 2018, funded by the homonym ERC project Stable and Chaotic Motions in the Planetary problem.
The aim of this school is to study in depth the dynamics of planetary systems from the underlying mathematical theories coming from perturbation theories and going back to A. N. Kolmogorov, V. I. Arnold and J. Moser, up to the recent astronomical observations of comets, asteroids and exoplanets from ground and space.</description>

      <description>The Department of Mathematics at University of Houston will host the fifth annual Houston Summer School on Dynamical Systems from May 17-25, 2017.
As in past years, the school is designed for graduate students; however, this year there will also be an opportunity for undergraduate students to participate, arriving two days early and then staying for the main event.
The following short courses are planned:
 Statistical properties in hyperbolic dynamics (Vaughn Climenhaga, Will Ott, Andrew Török - University of Houston) Partially hyperbolic dynamics (Todd Fisher - Brigham Young University) Dynamical methods in Diophantine approximation (Alan Haynes - University of Houston) Dynamics of group actions on homogeneous spaces (Anish Ghosh - Tata Institute of Fundamental Research) Linearly recurrent systems (Valérie Berthé - Univ.</description>

&amp;ldquo;A geometric model for the natural extension of continued fraction maps&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: Just as classical &amp;ldquo;Floor&amp;rdquo; continued fractions induce the Gauss map on the real unit interval, other euclidean division algorithms (Ceiling, Even, Odd, NearestInteger, &amp;hellip;) induce piecewise-fractional maps with integer coefficients. All these maps have natural extensions that can easily be described on an ad hoc basis.
We present a general framework for dealing with all these maps in a uniform way.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Ergodicity of Surface Actions via Flag Manifold&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: This talk is devoted to study the ergodicity of smooth surface actions. We provide a sufficient condition for surface actions to be ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure. First, we address the main results obtained so far for the unit circle, as a main tool in higher dimensional. After that, by introducing the notion of flag manifold, we explain how rich minimality of sufficiently smooth action on the flag manifold may lead to the ergodicity of the initial action.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Geometric constructions of Equilibrium States&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll show a completely different construction of equilibrium states associated to Hölder potentials for hyperbolic systems, and indicate the necessary modifications to deal with certain partially hyperbolic cases. The key point for this extension is avoiding altoghether the use of symbolic dynamics and the Perron-Frobenious method. Time permiting I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss applications. This is a joint project with F.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Martingale approximation for parametrised dynamical systems&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: In joint work with Alexey Korepanov and Zemer Kosloff, we prove statistical limit laws for sequences of the type \(\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}v_n\circ T_n^j\) where \(T_n\) is a family of nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations. The key ingredient is a new martingale-coboundary decomposition for nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations which is useful in the case when the family \(T_n\) is replaced by a fixed transformation \(T\), but which is particularly useful in the case when \(T_n\) varies with \(n\).</description>

“Families of hyperbolic Hamiltonian tori”
Thursday 11 February 2016, 15.00
Dipartimento di Matematica (aula Dal Passo) Università di Roma “Tor Vergata”
Abstract:
In integrable Hamiltonian systems hyperbolic tori form families, parametrised by the actions conjugate to the toral angles. The union over such a family is a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold. Under Diophantine conditions a hyperbolic torus persists a small perturbation away from integrability. Locally around such a torus the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold is the centre manifold of that torus and persists as well.</description>

“Permutable entire functions and multiply connnected wandering domains”
Abstract: Let f and g be permutable transcendental entire functions. It is a long standing question whether the Julia sets of f and g are equal. The conjecture is true in the case that f,g are rational functions, and in the transcendental case the main issues are due to the presence of Baker Domains and Wandering Domains.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Sharp mixing rates via inducing with respect to general return times&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: For non-uniformly expanding maps inducing w.r.t. a general (i.e., not necessarily first) return time to Gibbs Markov maps, we provide sufficient conditions for obtaining sharp estimates for the correlation function. This applies to both the finite and the infinite measure setting.</description>

      <description>On Thursday 3rd September there will be a special session at the 17th European Women in Maths general meeting in Cortona on &amp;ldquo;Dynamical aspects of number theory&amp;rdquo;. It runs from 10:00 - 13:00, and there will be short talks by Valerie Berthé, Karma Dajani, Charlene Kalle, Henna Koivusalo and Nicola Oswald.
Registration for the conference is unfortunately already closed, but if anyone is nearby and wants to come only for this morning session, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine there would be any problem.</description>

      <description>When: Wednesday July 22, 2015, at 11:30
Where: Seminario I, Dept. of Mathematics, Università di Bologna
Who: Francesco Cellarosi (Queen&amp;rsquo;s University, Canada)
What: Seminar &amp;ldquo;Recent progress towards Sarnak’s and Chowla’s Conjectures&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: I will present an overview of Sarnak’s conjecture on the disjointness of the Möbius function from any deterministic sequence and the related Chowla’s conjecture on the self-correlations of the Möbius function. Some progress towards weaker versions of these conjectures have been made recently, and I planto illustrate them.</description>

&amp;ldquo;AN INTEGRABLE BILLIARD CLOSE TO AN ELLIPSE OF SMALL ECCENTRICITY IS AN ELLIPSE&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: In 1927 G. Birkhoff conjectured that if a billiard in a strictly convex smooth domain is integrable, the domain has to be an ellipse (or a circle). The conjecture is still wide open, and presents remarkable relations with open questions in inverse spectral theory and spectral rigidity.</description>
