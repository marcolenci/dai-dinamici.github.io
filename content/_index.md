The **DinAmicI** are a group of Italian and adoptive Italian researchers
in dynamical systems.

If you do research in dynamical systems and have anything to do with
Italy (nationality, residence, current or past positions in Italian
institutions, or you just like us), we encourage you to register to this
web site and be part of the group! You can also subscribe to our
newsletter, which is a weekly digest of the new content added to the
site. Use the links in the left-hand column of the page, or the footer,
if you are using a mobile device.

Since the fall of 2020, the community also includes the [**UMI Group
DinAmicI**](https://umi.dm.unibo.it/gruppi-umi-2/gruppo-umi-dinamici/),
a work group of the [Unione Matematica
Italiana](https://umi.dm.unibo.it/), the Italian society of
mathematicians.
