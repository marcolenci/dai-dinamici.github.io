ESA have opened the call for university students to participate in the
space debris training course for 2019.

The course will be hosted  at the [ESA Academy's Training & Learning
Facility](http://www.esa.int/Education/ESA_Academy/What_is_the_ESA_Academy)
in ESEC-Galaxia, Transinne, Belgium, from 13 to 17 May 2019.

University students will be provided with an introduction to the concept
of space debris, why it is necessary to address this problem, and how
the mitigation policies set by ESA apply to missions.

Participants will not only learn about the space debris environment and
mitigation technologies, but also about how it impacts spacecraft
operations and potential future solutions.

The deadline for applications is 25 March 2019.
