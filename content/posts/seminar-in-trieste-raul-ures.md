"Ergodicity and Partial Hyperbolicity on Unit Tangent Bundles of
Sufaces"

Abstract: A diffeomorphism is partially hyperbolic if the tangent bundle
of the ambient manifold splits into three invariant sub-bundles,  \\(TM
= E\_s \\oplus E\_c \\oplus E\_u\\), in such a way that \\(df\\)
contracts the vectors of \\(E\_s\\) and expands the vectors of
\\(E\_u\\) while the vectors of \\(E\_c\\) have an intermediate
behavior. We will present some new advances in the study of the
ergodicity of volume preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms
acting on the unit tangent bundle of hyperbolic surfaces.
