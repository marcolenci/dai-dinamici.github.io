The Mathematical Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts
will host the **Belgrade Summer School on Dynamics**, July 17-22, 2021,
organized by Vladimir Dragović (UTD/MISANU) and Vadim Kaloshin (IST,
Austria).

The target audience is undergraduate and graduate students and
researchers from Serbia, the region, and around the globe interested in
modern dynamics.  
  
The school will be organized online with possible hybrid elements, if
the situation with the pandemic permits. The lectures will be given by:

-   Marcel Guardia (UPC, Barcelona)
-   Hamid Hezari (UC Irvine)
-   Vadim Kaloshin (IST, Wien)
-   Martin Leguil (UPJV, Amiens)

The event is supported by the Seminars Mathematical Methods of Mechanics
and Combinatorics, Geometry, Topology, and Algebra and by the journal
Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

All interested should contact Filip Jevtić by e-mail:
<BelDyn21@mi.sanu.ac.rs>  
by June 17, 2021.

The application material consists of a CV, a short statement of interest
