has granted the funding of a Collaborative Research Centre / Transregio
(CRC/TRR 191) on *Symplectic Structures in Geometry, Algebra and
Dynamics*. This CRC is based at the universities of
[Bochum](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ruhr-uni-bochum.de%2Fffm%2Findex.html.de&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHerCPkRUk7UFWcNrW8oIkD2EjogQ),

University.

Within this CRC, 17 individual projects will be funded. The funding
comprises: 12 full-time postdoctoral positions (pd) and 24 positions for
doctoral students (ds).

Currently we have openings for **4 postdoctoral positions (pd)
and 12 positions for doctoral students (ds)**. Payment is based on the
German TVL-13 scale if terms and conditions under collective bargaining
laws are fulfilled; Ph.D. students will be given 75% positions.

**All candidates should specify the project(s) to which they apply.**
