*"Lagrange spectrum of Veech translation surfaces"*

The Lagrange spectrum is a classical object in Diophantine approximation
on the real line that has been generalised to many different settings.
In particular, recently it has been generalised to a similar object for
translation surfaces, which attracted quite some attention in the field.
We study the Lagrange spectrum in the contest of Veech translation
surfaces. These are particular translation surfaces with many
symmetries, that can be thought as a dynamical equivalent of the torus
in higher genera. Together with L. Marchese and C. Ulcigrai, we show
that for such surfaces, similarly to what happens in the classical case,
the Lagrange spectrum contains an infinite interval, called Hall ray. In
our construction we use coding of hyperbolic geodesics and we deduce a
formula that allows to describe high values in the spectrum as a sum of
two Cantor sets.

*"Singular values and periodic points"*

We consider the iteration of entire transcendental functions on the
complex plane. A special role is played by periodic points, that is
points such that \\( f^n(z)=z \\)  for some \\(n\\).  Other special
points are the singular values, that is points near which not all
inverse branches of \\(f\\) are well defined and univalent (for example,
critical values, or asymptotic values, like \\(0\\) for the map
\\(e^z\\)).  We investigate the interplay between singular values,
non-repelling periodic points and families of periodic curves called
dynamic rays. We use topologial and geometric techniques. Our work also
gives a new and  direct  proof of the famous  Fatou-Shishikura
inequality for functions with finitely many singular values with bounded
postsingular set, asserting that the number of non-repelling cycles is
bounded by the number of singular values. This is joint work with N.

*"Slippery Devil's Staircases"*

In this talk, we consider various examples, classical and more recent,
of Slippery Devil's staircases, or, in other words, strictly increasing
functions of the unit interval with derivative Lebesgue-almost
everywhere equal to zero. Often, but not always, these functions appear
as topological conjugacy maps between two dynamical systems, for
example, then well-known and well-studied Minkowski question-mark
function, which can be seen as the the topological conjugacy map between
the Farey and tent systems. We consider the possible values, other than
zero, that the derivative of such functions can take, the Hausdorff
dimension of the exceptional sets and some perturbation results. We also
offer some hopefully interesting open questions.
