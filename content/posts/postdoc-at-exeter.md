**Postdoctoral position in Dynamical Systems at the University of
Exeter**

This post is available from <span term="goog_753984452">01 November
2017</span> for 36 months to support the work of Mark Holland.

The University of Exeter is a Russell Group university that combines
world-class research with very high levels of student satisfaction.
Exeter has over 21,000 students from more than 130 different countries
and is in the top 1% of universities in the world with 98% of its
research rated as being of international quality. Our research focuses
on some of the most fundamental issues facing humankind today.

This post is funding by the EPSRC on a project titled: "A geometric view
of extremes in dynamical systems."

Predicting high impact extreme events, such as severe weather and
climatic events is a major challenge. Using innovative mathematical
techniques this project will determine phenomenological mechanisms that
lead to the occurrence of extremes, and develop a theory that can be
used to predict when such events occur in physical modelling
applications. Using dynamical systems theory, the project will use
geometrical features of the underlying mathematical models to determine
the future extreme behaviour.

**The post will include:**

**Original research **contributing to the above project.** **The
successful applicant will be able to present information on research
progress and outcomes, communicate complex information, orally, in
writing and electronically and prepare proposals and applications to
external bodies.** **

**Training & collaboration: **the successful applicant will collaborate
across disciplines and will actively participate in seminars, workshops
and conferences in the subject area.

Applicants will possess a relevant PhD in the general area of
Mathematics and be able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge in the
discipline and of research methods and techniques to work within
established research programmes.
