+++
The Ph.D. school in Information Engineering of the University of
Florence has recently funded a scholarship in "Topological
characterization of network dynamics". The scholarship falls within the
university program in multidisciplinary education, and therefore it is
open to graduate students coming from various fields, such as
Engineering, Physics and Mathematics. The scholarship lasts 3 years, and
it is completely funded during this time. The winner has to attend the
Ph.D. school during these years and will have to write a dissertation to
earn the PhD degree.

The ideal candidate is a student familiar with Dynamical Systems, and
also with the concept of "network of dynamic agents". Experience in
ODEs, PDEs or stochastic models is appreciated, but it is not necessary.

Interested students must apply before **August 10th, 12:00 am** (Italian
time), by using the web form at the following link:
<http://www.unifi.it/cmpro-v-p-11202.html>

Complete information about the application procedure can be found at the
same link in English.

The application requires the candidate to submit a project and to attend
an interview. The project should be about 2 pages long, and it should be
a research proposal based on the skills and interests of the candidate.
Candidates may ask the tutors for the original research outline, and
freely adapt it to make it their own project. The final choice of the
type of scholarship will be done only at the end of the selection
process.

Candidates are encouraged to get in touch with the scholarship tutors
before the deadline for more information about how to better present
their project and summary of previous research. The interview will be
performed remotely via Skype or other services for foreign students
(fair knowledge of English is required).

For more information, feel free to contact the scholarship tutors
Giacomo Innocenti (<giacomo.innocenti@unifi.it>) or Duccio Fanelli
(<duccio.fanelli@unifi.it>) at any time.
