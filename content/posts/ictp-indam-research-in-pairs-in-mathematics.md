<div class="content">

ICTP and the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica (INdAM) have launched
a joint program of "Research in Pairs" aimed to fund research project in
Mathematics to be carried out in collaboration between mathematicians
from developing countries and INdAM members either at ICTP in Trieste or
in any research unit of INdAM (see the list at
<http://www.altamatematica.it/it/node/43>).

Applications must be submitted using the online system
<https://e-applications.ictp.it/applicant/login/math_pairs>; the
deadline is 15 September 2016.

Applicants must be citizens of a developing
country (see <http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#developed> for
a list of developing countries) and must have worked in a developing
country for at least 6 months in the previous calendar year. After
filling the personal profile, the applicant must provide the following
information:

-   a detailed research project (between 2000 and 3000 characters);
-   a precise working plan, with timing and places where the proposed
    project would be carried out;
-   a detailed breakdown of costs, including the requested amount and a
    description of possible other sources of funding. The maximum amount
    of a request is fixed in Euros 4000.

The applicant can indicate up to two "team members" from a developing
country (not necessarily the same as the applicant's) and up to two
INdAM members, who are inscribed in the list of one of the national
research groups [GNAMPA](http://www.altamatematica.it/gnampa/node/30),
[GNCS](http://www.altamatematica.it/gncs/node/64),
[GNFM](http://www.altamatematica.it/gnfm/it/node/33),
[GNSAGA](http://www.altamatematica.it/gnsaga/node/22).

Once the application is completed the INdAM partners will be contacted
electronically to agree, fill in their scientific profile, and possibly
add further information. Applicants are encouraged to coordinate the
present research project with the participation in other scientific
activities such as schools and workshops either run by ICTP or INdAM. At
the end of the project all members of the team will be required to write
a final report.
