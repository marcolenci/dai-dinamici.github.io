Thanks to the efforts and the patience of Giovanni Canestrari, and the pushes from Marco Lenci, the DinAmicI are excited to share wity you the new logo:

![New Logo by Giovanni Canestrari]({{< resource url="images/logo.png" >}})

Throughout those years, we have gone through a number of iterations.
The original

![Original logo]({{< resource url="wp-content/DAI-orig.png" >}})

only lasted a few weeks, before being modified into

![Original logo with ball]({{< resource url="wp-content/DAI-orig-1.png" >}})

After that, we decided to work on our classical animation

![Animated Logo]({{< resource url="wp-content/DINAMICI_2_2.gif" >}})

and the corresponding

![Latest logo]({{< resource url="wp-content/DAI1.png" >}})

The new logo, and the new website, mark a new step into the development of the group and the association.
