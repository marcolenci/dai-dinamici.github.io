"Geometric constructions of Equilibrium States"

Abstract: In this talk I'll show a completely different construction of
equilibrium states associated to Hölder potentials for hyperbolic
systems, and indicate the necessary modifications to deal with certain
partially hyperbolic cases. The key point for this extension is avoiding
altoghether the use of symbolic dynamics and the Perron-Frobenious
method. Time permiting I'll discuss applications. This is a joint
project with F. Rodriguez-Hertz (PSU).
