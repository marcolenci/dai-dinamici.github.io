"Martingale approximation for parametrised dynamical systems"

Abstract: In joint work with Alexey Korepanov and Zemer Kosloff, we
prove statistical limit laws for sequences of the type
\\(\\sum\_{j=0}^{n-1}v\_n\\circ T\_n^j\\) where \\(T\_n\\) is a family
of nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations.  The key ingredient is a new
martingale-coboundary decomposition for nonuniformly hyperbolic
transformations which is useful in the case when the family \\(T\_n\\)
is replaced by a fixed transformation \\(T\\), but which is particularly
useful in the case when \\(T\_n\\) varies with \\(n\\).
