*Title:* ***Matching for random systems with an application to minimal weight expansions***

*Abstract:* We consider families of skew-product maps, representing
systems evolving in discrete time in which, at each time step, one of a
number of transformations is chosen according to an i.i.d process and
applied. We extend the notion of matching for such dynamical systems and
we show that, for a certain family of piecewise affine random maps of
the interval, the property of random matching implies that any invariant
density is piecewise constant. We give an application by introducing a
one-parameter family of random maps generating signed binary expansions
of numbers. This family has random matching for Lebesgue almost every
