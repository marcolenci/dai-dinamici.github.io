Due to the current Covid-related restrictions in Italy, the [Third
DinAmicI Day](http://daiday2020.unisalento.it/) (also abbreviated 3rd
DAI Day) will take place online. It will also be split into two
afternoons, December 17 and 18, 2020, instead of a single full day, as
[previously
announced](https://www.dinamici.org/third-dai-day-save-the-date/).

A website with the program of the event and all related information
(including a link to download the poster) is up:

See you all online!
