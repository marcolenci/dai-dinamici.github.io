A Summer School in Dynamical Systems which will be held at ICTP, Trieste
(Italy) on 16-27 July 2018.

[http://indico.ictp.it/event/8325/](http://indico.ictp.it/event/8325/)

The school is targeted to Masters and beginning PhD students and aims at
introducing a variety of fundamental ideas and techniques in dynamics.
The first week will not assume prior knowledge in the field of dynamical
systems. Students can also register for the second week only.

Female students are especially encouraged to apply. A limited number of
grants are available to support the attendance of selected participants,
with priority given to participants from developing countries.

**Organizers and lectures:**

-Jana RODRIGUEZ-HERTZ (Southern University of Science and Technology of
China)

-Corinna ULCIGRAI (University of Bristol, UK)

-Amie WILKINSON (University of Chicago, USA)

Local organizer: Stefano Luzzatto (ICTP)

**Week 1**

*[u](u)A circle of concepts and methods in dynamics.[/u](/u)*

Basic concepts in dynamics will be introduced, with many examples,
especially in the setting of circle maps. Topics include rotations of
the circle, doubling map, Gauss map and continued fractions and an
introduction to the basic ideas of symbolic codings and invariant
measures. At the end of the week we will discuss some simple examples of
structural stability and renormalization.

**Week 2**

[u](u)*Ergodicity in smooth dynamics*[/u](/u) (10h, Jana Rodriguez-Hertz and
Amie Wilkinson)

The concept of ergodicity is a central hypothesis in statistical
mechanics, one whose origins can be traced to Boltzmann's study of ideal
gases in the 19th century. Loosely speaking, a dynamical system is
ergodic if it does not contain any proper subsystem, where the notion of
"proper" is defined using measures. A powerful theorem of Birkhoff from
the 1930's states that ergodicity is equivalent to the property that
"time averages = space averages:" that is, the average value of a
function taken along an orbit is the same as the average value over the
entire space. The property of ergodicity is the first stepping stone in
a path through the study of statistical properties of dynamical systems,
a field known as Ergodic Theory.

We will develop the ergodic theory of smooth dynamical systems, starting
with the fundamental, linear examples of rotations and doubling maps on
the circle introduced in Week 1. We will develop some tools necessary to
establish ergodicity of nonlinear smooth systems, such as those
investigated by Boltzmann and Poincaré in the dawn of the subject of
Dynamical Systems. Among these tools are distortion estimates, density
points, invariant foliations and absolute continuity. Closer to the end
of the course, we will focus on the ergodic theory of Anosov
diffeomorphisms, an important family of "toy models" of chaotic
dynamical systems.

*[u](u)Renormalization in entropy zero systems[/u](/u)* (5h, Corinna Ulcigrai)

Rotations of the circle are perhaps the most basic examples of low
complexity (or "entropy zero") dynamical systems. A key idea to study
systems with low complexity is renormalization. The Gauss map and
continued fractions can be seen as a tool to renormalize rotations,
i.e.study the behaviour of a rotation on finer and finer scales. We will
see two more examples of renormalization in action.

The first is the characterization of Sturmian sequences, which arise as
symbolic coding of trajectories of rotations (and hint at more recent
developments, such as the characterization of cutting sequences for
billiards in the regular octagon). The second concerns interval exchange
maps (IETs), which are generalizations of rotations. We will introduce
the Rauzy-Veech algorithm as a tool to renormalize IETs. As
applications, we will give some ideas of how it can be used (in some
simplified settings) to study invariant measures and (unique) ergodicity
and deviations of ergodic averages for IETs.
