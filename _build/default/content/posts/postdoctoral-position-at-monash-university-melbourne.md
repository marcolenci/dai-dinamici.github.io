A candidate is sought for a position for the role of Postdoctoral
Research Fellow on a project studying chaotic dynamical
systems on 3-dimensional manifolds. Candidates with expertise in any of
the fields of dynamical systems, ergodic theory, foliation theory, and
the geometry and topology of 3-manifolds are strongly encouraged to
apply.

The Postdoctoral Fellow will conduct research at the School of
Mathematical Sciences, Monash University, under the guidance of Dr Andy
Hammerlindl. This research will focus on topics related to an Australian
Research Council Discovery Project on geometric advances in partially
hyperbolic dynamics. This project is in collaboration with Georg
Gottwald (University of Sydney), Christian Bonatti (Université de
Bourgogne), and Rafael Potrie (Universidad de la República – Uruguay).
There will also be opportunities for the Postdoctoral Fellow to
collaborate with others in the School of Mathematics at Monash and
pursue their own independent research programme.

Applicants must have a PhD in a relevant discipline, proven ability to
perform collaborative research, and the potential to publish in high
quality journals.

This role is a two year full-time position, with the possibility of
further extension. Flexible working arrangements may be negotiated.

**Closing date:**

21 February 2018
