The school:

**"Stable and Chaotic Motions in the Planetary Problem"**

will take place in Asiago (Italy), June 10-15 2018,
funded by the homonym ERC project Stable and Chaotic Motions in the
Planetary problem.

The aim of this school is to study in depth the dynamics of planetary
systems from  the underlying mathematical theories coming from
perturbation theories and going back to A. N. Kolmogorov,  V. I. Arnold
and J. Moser, up to the recent astronomical observations of comets,
asteroids and exoplanets from ground and space.

We foresee 18 hourly mathematical and 10 astronomical lectures.

a\) The Mathematical Lectures: -Alessandra Celletti, Univ. Tor Vergata,
Roma (lectures on KAM Theorem); -Vadim Kaloshin, University of Maryland
& ETH, Zurigo (Arnold diffusion); -Richard Moeckel, University of
Minnesota (the N-Body problem); -Tere Seara, UPC, Barcellona (Arnold
diffusion);

b\) The Astronomical Lectures (10 hours): -Alessandro Morbidelli,
Observatoire de la Coste d’Azure, Nice (evolution of planetary systems)
-Ivano Bertini, University of Padova (space missions, comets);
-Foriangela La Forgia, University of Padova (comets); -Francesco
Marzari, University of Padova (extrasolar planets dynamics)

The precise titles and abstracts will be soon announced. The lectures
will be held at the Astrophysical Observatory in Asiago.

If you are interested to participate, please register by sending an
e-mail to [asiagoschool@math.unipd.it](asiagoschool@math.unipd.it), by includig also a short CV,
before 30 April.

The participation to the school is open to Phd students, Post doc
researchers and researchers. We strongly encourage the participation of
Phd and Post-Doc researchers. We will be able to cover the local
expenses for a limited number of young participants: to apply for
financial support please mention it in the registration e-mail.

The selection of the participants and of the financial support will be
confirmed by e-mail.

Accomodation: a limited number of rooms (cheap, from 10 to 15 euros per
day, but comfortable; with kithchen facility) are available in the guest
rooms at the Observatory. Further information on other possible
accomodations will be soon available.

Please feel free to forward this information to anyone you know who
might be interested.
